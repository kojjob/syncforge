- [x] Request body size limit (1MB on Plug.Parsers)

### 8.3 Observability (PR #35)
- [x] Health check endpoint (GET /health — DB connectivity check, 200/503)
- [x] Custom telemetry metrics (room join/leave counters, channel message counter, presence/room gauges)
- [x] Structured JSON logging (LoggerJSON 7.0 for production)
- [x] Error tracking (Sentry v10 — Logger-based, activated by SENTRY_DSN env var)
- [x] Logger metadata (user_id, room_id added to all log entries)

### 8.4 Deployment (PR #36)
- [x] OTP release module (Syncforge.Release — migrate/0, rollback/2 without Mix)
- [x] Multi-stage Dockerfile (hexpm/elixir builder + debian slim runner, nobody user)
- [x] Fly.io configuration (fly.toml — iad region, rolling deploy, auto-stop/start)
- [x] BEAM clustering (rel/env.sh.eex — DNS-based node discovery on Fly.io)
- [x] Release scripts (rel/overlays/bin/server, rel/overlays/bin/migrate)
- [x] CI pipeline (GitHub Actions — tests, format, compile)
- [x] CD pipeline (GitHub Actions — deploy to Fly.io on push to main)

## Technical Debt

| Item | Priority | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Unused `socket` warnings | Low | 3 warnings in room_channel_test.exs (lines 333, 418, 683) |
| Duplicated `pick_org/2` | Low | Same helper copy-pasted across 6 LiveViews — extract to shared module |
| Comment popovers | Low | Inline comment popover UI component not yet built |

| Package | Version | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `hammer` | `~> 7.0` | Rate limiting (ETS backend) |
| `hammer_plug` | `~> 3.0` | Plug integration for Hammer |
| `corsica` | `~> 2.1` | CORS configuration |
| `logger_json` | `~> 7.0` | Structured JSON logging |
| `sentry` | `~> 10.0` | Error tracking |

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Presence sync | <50ms | - |
| Cursor broadcast | <30ms | - |
| WebSocket latency | <100ms | - |
| Room join time | <200ms | - |
